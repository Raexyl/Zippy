# Zippy
Basic 2D Rendering Engine (Linux Only)

Todo: -
 - How to cancel main() when GLFW fails to init?
 - How to cancel when shader compilation fails?
 - Make sure includes are sensible? - Which ones should be hidden?
 - Add more Renderer methods
 - Add more Input methods

Project Aims: -
 - Draw hollow polygons.
 - Draw filled polygons.
 - Apply textures to shapes.

Build instructions for Linux only: - 
 - Clone git repository.
 - cd into it (or open the repository in the terminal)
 - run "make clean" in the terminal
 - cd into the build directory
 - call "./Zippy" in the terminal

 - If you wish to change the application, edit Game.cpp as you wish, then rebuild as above.
